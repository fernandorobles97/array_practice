## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel like I understand the foundation of arrays, but with all the different methods and configurations there are, that leaves a lot more to be discovered around the concept.
## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I'm interested in learning more of the differet methods there are to use with arrays, but ultimtately I think being able to retain the foundations about arrays is more important for me now.
## What questions do you have about Arrays?
- Because it seems like there are so many methods to try and remember, which are the ones that would be most beneficial to work on memorizing?
